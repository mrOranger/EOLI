# EOLI
The project is an interpreter for a C-like language, implemented using Haskell and concepts of Monads, Parser and Functor. The whole project is divided in modules, each one regarding a specific part of the interpreter.
1. The $main$ module contains the main method to start the interpreter.
2. The $Aexp$ module contains the definition of the grammar and the parser for the Arithmetich Expressions.
3. The $Bexp$ module contains the definition of the grammar and the parser for the Boolean Expressions.
3. The $Cexp$ module contains the definition of the grammar and the parser for the Command Expressions.

More details are provided in the .pdf documentations. To run this project is necessary to compile it, using an Haskell compiler as ghci. The project has been tested both for Windows and Ubuntu.
